# MCP-dump

A collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and agents for experimentation and learning.

## Overview

This repository contains multiple projects demonstrating different ways to build and interact with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. The goal is to explore MCP server implementations, experiment with LLM context management, and provide reference setups for others interested in MCP.

- [`ai-agent-postgres-mcp`](ai-agent-postgres-mcp/): Demonstrates connecting an AI agent to a Postgres database via MCP for advanced analysis and conversational querying.
- [`mcp-hello`](mcp-hello/): A minimal MCP server implementation using Cloudflare Workers.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol for interfacing with large language models (LLMs) and managing conversational or contextual state between prompts and responses. MCP standardizes communication with LLMs, enabling more reliable and consistent interactions.

## Purpose

This repository exists to:

- Learn and experiment with MCP server and agent implementations
- Test different approaches to MCP and LLM context management
- Explore optimizations and variations in MCP setups
- Serve as reference implementations for the community

## Getting Started

To try any project in this repository:

1. Navigate to the desired project directory (e.g., [`mcp-hello`](mcp-hello/), [`ai-agent-postgres-mcp`](ai-agent-postgres-mcp/))
2. Follow the instructions in that directory's `README.md`
3. Install any required dependencies
4. Run the server or agent as described

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit your own MCP server or agent implementations, or improvements to existing ones, via pull requests.

## Disclaimer

These projects are for educational and experimental purposes. They may not be production-ready or follow all best practices. Use at your own risk.
