# MCP-dump

A collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers built out of curiosity.

## Overview

This repository contains various MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementations created for experimental and learning purposes. The primary goal of this project is to explore different approaches to building MCP servers and to better understand the protocol's capabilities and limitations.

## Structure

```
└── jayanth-mkv-mcp-dump/
    └── mcp-hello/
```

The repository is organized into different server implementations, with `mcp-hello` being the first example. Each directory contains a standalone MCP server implementation.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol designed for interfacing with large language models (LLMs) and managing context between prompts and responses. It provides a standardized way to communicate with language models, allowing for more consistent and reliable interactions.

## Purpose

This collection exists primarily for:

- Learning and experimental purposes
- Testing different MCP server implementations
- Exploring optimizations and variations in MCP setups
- Serving as reference implementations for others interested in MCP

## Getting Started

To use any of the MCP servers in this repository:

1. Navigate to the specific server directory (e.g., `mcp-hello/`)
2. Follow the instructions in that directory's README (if available)
3. Install any required dependencies
4. Run the server according to its documentation

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute your own MCP server implementations or improvements to existing ones. All contributions should be made through pull requests.

## Disclaimer

These servers are built out of curiosity and for educational purposes. They may not be production-ready or follow all best practices. Use at your own risk.
